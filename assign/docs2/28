The Communist Party of India will move the court against the proposed hydrocarbon exploration project in the Cauvery delta region. Disclosing this to the media in Tiruvarur on Thursday, CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan said that the granary of Tamil Nadu faces imminent threat of extinction in view of the adamant stand taken by the Union government to implement hydrocarbon exploration project in the delta region. Granting of permission to sink wells in 274 places across the six districts — Villupuram, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram — would ruin the region, he alleged. Though it was announced earlier that the project would be shelved, Mr. Mutharasan alleged the Union government had again reversed its stand and had granted permission for the project. The CPI was approaching this matter as a public issue and hence had started forming committees in villages to organise protests against the project. The demonstrations would gain momentum after May 23, the scheduled date for counting of votes polled in the Parliamentary elections, he added. While Puducherry Chief Minister had openly declared that the hydrocarbon project would not be allowed in their soil, the silence of the rulers in Tamil Nadu raised doubts whether they supported the project, he said.
