Congress Rajya Sabha member K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao has urged Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan to order an inquiry into the conditions laid down by the Centre to allow the State government to execute the Polavaram project and facilitate publication of a White Paper on the issue. In a 15-page representation submitted to the Governor in Hyderabad on Thursday, Mr. Ramachandra Rao alleged that the TDP government had additionally burdened the State exchequer to the tune of ₹30,000 crore in the execution of the project by agreeing to meet the price escalation after cut-off date of April 1, 2014. The agreement between the Centre and the State governments was a “blatant violation” of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Mr. Ramachandra Rao explained. Giving the history of the project in detail, the MP urged the Governor to inquire and make public the identity of the person who, on behalf of the State government, had asked the Union Government and NITI Aayog to allow the State government to execute the project under several conditions that were against the interests of Andhra Pradesh. He wanted the Governor to direct the State government to publish a White Paper on the project detailing the terms and conditions between the State and the Union governments and the several Central agencies involved, and the funds released till date. The MP urged the Governor to make public the conditions the Centre imposed to allow the State to execute the project that was a national project. The MP also asked the Governor to direct the State to immediately file a counter affidavit to the PIL filed by him in the HC in 2017.
