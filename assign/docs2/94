Sangareddy MLA T. Jagga Reddy has said the Telangana Congress would be more interested to see AICC president Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister and would not mind to take the support of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). “Seeing Mr. Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister would be more important for us and we would follow the AICC directions on the issue even if the TRS support was must for it. As of now our aim to not to grab power in Telangana but to see Mr. Gandhi as the PM,” he said speaking to reporters at Gandhi Bhavan on Thursday. Backing TPCC chief, he said he would write a letter to the AICC president to continue Mr. Uttam Reddy even after the Parliament elections. In case, Mr. Reddy wants to opt out, the names of Mr. Sreedhar Babu and Mr. Revanth Reddy could be considered. He said the party would win five Lok Sabha seats and Mr. Uttam Reddy, Mr. Komatireddy Venkata Reddy and Renuka Chowdary would become Union ministers when the UPA is voted to power. Revanth Reddy and Konda Vishweshwer Reddy are the other two candidates who would win in the Lok Sabha elections, according to him. Mr. Reddy alleged that the TRS leaders were trying to blackmail the Congress leaders showing small mistakes committed by them. Police is toeing the line of the ruling party leaders and they should remember that Congress would come back to power.
