Green activists and local farmers at the foothills of Kolli Hills have created a small pond to support farmers and improve groundwater level in the region. The activists from ‘Wake our Lake’ organisation and the farmers together bought 2 to 3 acres of land at the foothills at Belukurichi to create the pond spending ₹ 7 lakh, through continuous efforts for over three months. The volunteers said that the lake would support 500 farmers in the region. Saravanan Thiyagarajan, founder of ‘Wake our Lake’ said that the Kumaran pond was set up after it was found that there were encroachments in the water channel to Thandagonder lake which was almost five km away from here. Once the Kumaran pond filled up, the overflowing water would reach Thandagounder lake. “The storage pond will prevent loss of water and will recharge groundwater table in the region,” he added.
