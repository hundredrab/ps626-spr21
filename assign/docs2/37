Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan on Thursday alleged widespread distribution of cash to voters in the Aravakurichi constituency and accused the Election Commission (EC) of failing to take action. “Distribution of cash for votes is in full swing. We know well what is going on here. It is happening everywhere. People know well. But, we don’t know whether the EC is aware of it or not,” said Mr. Haasan, while canvassing for votes in support of his party candidate for Aravakurichi constituency, S. Mohanraj, at Thoppampatti. Claiming that the officials should be aware of it, but remained mute spectators, Mr. Haasan said it posed a grave danger to democracy. Stating that the right to vote was comparable to chastity, he beseeched voters to refuse the money given for exercising their democratic right. “If you sell your vote, it is akin to pledging your life for five years and please don’t do it,” he told the voters. The MNM leader charged that both the Dravidian parties had ruled Tamil Nadu alternatively by looting the State. The MNM would offer the real change and it will stand for honesty and cleanliness in public life, he claimed. 51 held Meanwhile, the police arrested 51 members of the Hindu Munnani for staging protest against Mr. Haasan’s controversial speech made at the Aravakurichi constituency on Sunday. They were detained at Velayuthampalayam shortly before the arrival of Mr. Haasan for a public meeting on Thursday. The protesters were demanding the arrest of Mr. Haasan.
