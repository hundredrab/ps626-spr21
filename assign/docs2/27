PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Thursday asked why the release of Perarivalan and six others convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case is being delayed, when Hindi actor Sanjay Dutt, convicted in the Mumbai serial blasts case, was released from Yerwada Central Jail without consulting the Central government. The Hindu had reported that Yerwada prison authorities had confirmed that Sanjay Dutt was released without consulting the Centre, though he was booked under the Arms Act. It was unfair that the Centre, which did not take notice of Sanjay Dutt’s release, was trying to stop the release of the seven convicts, he said. “On the one hand, the Centre kept quiet when the Maharashtra government released Dutt without consulting it. One the other hand, when Jayalalithaa adopted a resolution to release the seven Tamils in 2014, then Congress government filed a case which prevented their release,” he said. Mr. Ramadoss added that the seven convicts were eligible to be released by the State and urged the government to take steps for the same.
