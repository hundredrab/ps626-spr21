Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamat leaders met officials in the Sri Lankan embassy in Chennai on Thursday to express their solidarity with the Easter bombing victims and urged them to prevent violence against Muslim community that erupted after the incident. “Terrorism has no religion and we Muslims condemn any act of terrorism happening in any part of the world. We pray for the return of peace in Sri Lanka. We have also conducted a massive protest against bomb blasts in Sri Lanka by terrorists,” said E. Mohamed, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamat, in a letter to the embassy officials here in Chennai. Condemning the consequent violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka, Mr. Mohamed said, “After the bomb blasts, the recent attack on Muslims, mosques and Muslim properties is not a good sign for Sri Lanka. Even though the curfew was implemented, the anti-Muslim rioters were roaming freely attacking Muslims.” He also demanded compensation for the victims of the riots.
