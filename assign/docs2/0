With only couple of days left for polling in the Kundgol byelection, both the national parties, the Congress and the BJP, are making every effort to win over the electorate. they are now seem to be keen on wooing Lingayats who have a significant presence in the constituency. While the BJP has fielded Lingayat candidate S.I. Chikkanagoudar, the Congress has fielded Kusumvati, wife of late Minister C.S. Shivalli, who belongs to the Kuruba community, which also has a good presence in the constituency. In a bid to woo Lingayat voters, the Congress had, on Wednesday, held a meeting with leaders of the community, including the former Minister Vinay Kulkarni, Congress leader Lakshmi Hebbalkar and Janata Dal(S) leader Mallikarjun Akki. A day after the Congress meeting of Lingayat leaders, the BJP too held a meeting of Lingayat leaders of Kundgol region and several other leaders of the community in the party. The meeting gains significance, as the BJP has been emphasising during the bypoll campaign that a win in Kundgol would mean a second term for B.S. Yeddyurappa (a Lingayat) as Chief Minister. It has also brought several Lingayat leaders for campaigning.
