The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer to examine a representation from a petitioner that sought the ordering of a repoll at a polling booth in Ponparappi in the Chidambaram (Reserved) Parliamentary constituency. Hearing a writ petition by Vishnuraj of Ponparappi in Ariyalur district, a vacation bench comprising Justices C.V. Karthikeyan and Krishnan Ramasamy directed the Chief Electoral Officer to examine his representation and pass appropriate orders. The bench disposed of the petition. The petition sought for a direction to the CEO for a re-polling in booth number 281 at Ponparappi village after considering his representation dated May 7. Vishnuraj, the petitioner, claimed that a communal clash prevented 275 voters from exercising their franchise on April 18.
