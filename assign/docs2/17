The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Coimbatore to appoint a Judicial Magistrate who would examine the body of T. Palanisamy, an employee of “Lottery King” Martin Santiago, who was found dead under mysterious circumstances. The court further rejected the plea for a CB-CID investigation into the case. A Division Bench of Justices C.V. Karthikeyan and Krishnan Ramasamy directed the Judicial Magistrate to examine the body of Palanisamy under Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and decide on whether to conduct a re-post-mortem. The Judicial Magistrate should submit a report to the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The Bench also rejected the plea of P. Rohin Kumar, the deceased’s son, for a CB-CID investigation into the death of his father, since the probe had already been transferred to the District Crime Branch and sections under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, had been invoked.
