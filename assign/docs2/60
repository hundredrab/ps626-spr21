Members of Hindu Munnani petitioned with Erode police on Thursday demanding action against Makkal Needhi Maiam leader Kamal Haasan for hurting Hindu sentiments. In their petition, the members alleged that Mr. Kamal Haasan made his alleged ‘Hindu terrorist’ comment at a minority community populated place with an aim to gain their votes. They alleged that Mr. Haasan had spoken in a way that would incite communal violence. The petitioners demanded that a case must be registered against him in this regard and necessary action must be taken.
