The horticulture department is gearing up for the inauguration of the 123rd Annual Flower Show on Friday, with last-minute preparations under way at the Government Botanical Garden. The flower show, which is the marquee event of the summer festival in the Nilgiris, is usually preceded by a variety of other events such as the Spices Show, the Rose Show and the Vegetable Show. However, due to the elections this year, only the flower show and the fruit show, which is to take place at Sims Park in Coonoor on May 25 and 26, are to take place this year. Horticulture department officials said that over 30,000 potted, flowering plants will be exhibited to the public during this year’s flower show, with the main viewing gallery already being arranged in preparation for this year’s show. Moreover, two main exhibits, featuring carnations and other flowers are also being readied and will be on show starting from Friday. “More than 1.5 lakh carnations have specially been brought in to make one of the two main flower exhibits,” an official from the horticulture department said. The lawns of the botanical garden are also being readied in expectation of the huge crowds. Horticulture department officials said that they expect more than 1 lakh people to visit the flower show this year. Though the summer season is expected to bring the usual avalanche of tourists this year to the Nilgiris, hoteliers in the district expect crowds to be fewer in number this year because of the elections as well as due to the fact that the flower show falls during the holy month of Ramadan, meaning far fewer tourists from Kerala will be making their way to the Nilgiris. The flower show will conclude on May 21.
