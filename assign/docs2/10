Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police A.R. Damodar on Thursday asked police officials to book criminal cases against persons lodging false complaints. Mr. Damodar said that many persons are harassing others by lodging false complaints and wasting valuable time of sub-inspectors and circle inspectors of many police stations. Participating in a monthly crime review meeting, the SP said that such measures would instill confidence among people and help the police devote time to genuine complaints. Mr. Damodar said that quick disposal of cases and prompt response to grievances would ensure immediate justice and prevent many possible crimes in the future. Many people who were booked under bindover cases during election season had violated the norms and caused disturbance in villages. “Officials should make them pay fines immediately. Otherwise, their properties should be seized,” he added. Additional Superintendent of Police M. Narasimha Rao, Bobbili Additional Superintendent of Police Gowthami Sali, DSPs D. Surya Sravan Kumar, M. Srinivasa Rao and other officials participated in the review meet.
