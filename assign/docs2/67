A massive eucalyptus tree was uprooted and almost crashed into the heritage train station in Coonoor, narrowly missing the main building and damaging a rest room and three parked cars after heavy rain lashed parts of the Nilgiris on Wednesday and Thursday. Officials from the fire and rescue services personnel from the Nilgiris said that heavy winds accompanied by rain on Wednesday had led to the tree falling on the vehicles. The tree narrowly missed the main building of the Coonoor Railway Station, but damaged three tourist vehicles which had been parked on the premises. No injuries were also reported. Personnel from the fire and rescue services said that they had been working since Thursday morning to remove the fallen branches, while the railways were also considering sanctioning the removal of the remaining eucalyptus trees at the station to ensure that they do not also get uprooted and cause damage to the heritage railway station. Local residents and heritage enthusiasts called on the railways to ensure that the trees posing a threat to the railway station be removed before the monsoon hits. Officials said that the Nilgiris received around 129 mm. of rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday, with Coonoor receiving the most at 34 mm. Many parts of the Nilgiris witnessed disruption during the rain on Wednesday, with parts of the towns of Udhagamandalam and Coonoor, especially low-lying areas witnessing flooding on Wednesday. Special precautions were taken at the Government Botanical Garden to prevent damage to the flowers and potted plants on exhibition.
