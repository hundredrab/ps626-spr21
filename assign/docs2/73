A man was shot dead by the police on Thursday — in an act of self-defence — when a three-member gang, allegedly engaged in a currency exchange racket, resisted arrest and tried to overpower the police. While two persons escaped, one man succumbed to his injuries. The identity of the victim was not divulged by the police though there is speculation that the gang was from Mumbai and had local contacts. However, sources also said the deceased was one Sukhwinder alias Durgesh, who was originally from Punjab. The police are on the lookout for his accomplices. The incident took place in the morning, when Vijayanagar police inspector B.G. Kumar led a posse of constables on receiving intelligence that three persons were engaged in a currency exchange racket. The police tried to intercept them, but two of them escaped. One tried to fight off the police, and in the melee got shot. He was shifted to K.R. Hospital but died. His body was taken to the mortuary under heavy security for post-mortem. Commissioner of Police K.T. Balakrishna confirmed the death and said the incident took place between 8.45 a.m. and 9.15 a.m. when the Vijaynagar police acted on receiving specific intelligence of the transaction and exchange of demonetised notes. He said investigations will be conducted as per the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) with regard to death during police encounters. The incident has heightened concerns over the spate of crimes in the city and surrounding areas. While an elderly couple was found murdered on the outskirts of Mysuru recently, it was followed by a spurt of chain-snatching incidents.
