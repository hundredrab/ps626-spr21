Scientists from Singapore are closely working on ‘robo-plants’, an experiment they call a fusion of nature and technology. They attached electrodes to a Venus flytrap plant. The electrodes arefilm-like and soft and fit tightly to the plant's surface. They are attached using a ‘thermogel’, which is liquid at low temperatures but turns into a gel at room temperature. These electrodes are capable of monitoring weak electrical pulses naturally emitted by plants.
