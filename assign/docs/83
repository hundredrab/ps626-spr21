On April 5, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath‚Äôs bite to ANI on COVID vaccination led to a Twitter storm after many pointed out that he used abusive language on camera. ‚ö†WARNING: Fake Yogi‚Äôs non-sanskari language ahead.  pic.twitter.com/JHHJBhjQrY ‚Äî AAP (@AamAadmiParty)  April 5, 2021 The UP CM was criticised by opposition parties and journalists for lashing out at a reporter. ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§µ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∂‡§æ‡§Ø‡§¶ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡•á:- ‡§Ö‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§¨‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü, ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à  ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•á 8 ‡§∏‡•á‡§ï‡•á‡§Ç‡§°‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§è ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§-‡§è-‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡§æ..üëá  pic.twitter.com/UYQXHcOyxv ‚Äî Srinivas B V (@srinivasiyc)  April 5, 2021 All the jokes and memes aside, we now live in times where the Chief Minister of a state abuses a media person on camera and ENBA awardees are all silent.

Video byte of UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Covid vaccination (Editors note: Earlier issued Live Sound byte is retracted)  pic.twitter.com/td9qQHSnrX ‚Äî ANI UP (@ANINewsUP)  April 5, 2021 Alt News contacted ANI editor-in-chief Smita Prakash for comment since the agency is yet to issue a statement. ‚ÄúI am not interested in speaking with you,‚Äù she said before hanging up. ANI UP bureau chief Kamna Hajela disconnected the call when asked about the video. UP CMO stated that the last three seconds of the viral clip are edited and a case will be registered against those sharing the viral video to tarnish the chief minister‚Äôs image. ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§è‡§Æ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡§æ‡§• ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡•ã‡§∂‡§≤ ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∞‡§≤ ‡§µ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§®‡•á ‡§´‡•á‡§ï ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø ‡§®‡•á ‡§á‡§∏‡•á ‡§è‡§°‡§ø‡§ü‡•á‡§° ‡§µ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä‡•§ ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§è‡§Æ ‡§ë‡§´‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§µ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ü‡§ñ‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á 3 ‡§∏‡•á‡§ï‡•á‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§´‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ ‡§è‡§°‡§ø‡§ü ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§õ‡§µ‡§ø ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ã‡§™ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡§¶‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ ‚Äî Anil Tiwari (@Interceptors)  April 5, 2021 Journalist Deepak Chaurasia came to Adityanath‚Äôs rescue and propaganda websites  OpIndia  and  Breaking Tube  published ‚Äòfact-check‚Äô articles. ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§è‡§Æ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ü‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ú‡§®‡§ï ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡•§ ‡§è‡§°‡§ø‡§ü‡•á‡§° ‡§®‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§è‡§Æ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ Video, ‡§µ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ü‡§ñ‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä 3 ‡§∏‡•á‡§ï‡•á‡§Ç‡§° ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§ó‡§è ‡§Ü‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ú‡§®‡§ï ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶‡•§  @shalabhmani ‚Äî Deepak Chaurasia (@DChaurasia2312)  April 5, 2021 The video has not been edited While ANI retracted the video, it is still available on broadcasts by other channels. Below is an ABP Ganga broadcast where Yogi Adityanath‚Äôs retracted bite can be heard  six minutes  onward. The redacted clip was also aired by  News18 Uttar Pradesh . Twitter user  @PatelSahabGJ  pointed that Adityanath can be heard using abusive language at 2:10 minutes in a  broadcast by First News Rajasthan  as well. Pro-BJP Twitter handles also came to Adityanath‚Äôs rescue including  @SocialTamasha  and  @BefittingFacts . The former shared a comparison video in an attempt to prove that the viral clip has been edited because, apart from the last three seconds, it is the same as the second bite tweeted by ANI. However, there are dissimilarities in both videos (highlighted in bold). The UP CM can be heard saying in the redacted clip, ‚ÄúI thank the honourable prime minister,  central health ministry from my heart  for providing COVID vaccine for free. I want to thank the country‚Äôs scientists. What are you doing, f******.‚Äù The reference to the health ministry was also tweeted by ANI. I thank PM & Union Health Ministry for making vaccine available free of cost. I also thank scientists of the country. The vaccine is completely safe. We all should take it when our turn comes: UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath  pic.twitter.com/jwhSfwsuIq ‚Äî ANI UP (@ANINewsUP)  April 5, 2021 In the video reshot by the news agency, the CM does not mention the central health ministry. ‚ÄúI thank the honourable prime minister for providing COVID vaccine for free to the  country‚Äôs citizens . I thank  all  the scientists  who launched two vaccines on time in India ‚Ä¶‚Äù he said. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath indeed used an abusive word in the presence of ANI crew. The claim that the video is edited is false. ANI, which is at the centre of the controversy, has chosen to not respond. Donate to Alt News!
